Blender can be controlled using program scripts written in Python. Recent Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT models can generate these Python scripts from simple English and execute them. This plugin provides an easy to use interface that integrates OpenAI's GPT models right in the UI, allowing you to use natural language commands to control Blender.

# Note

All GPT models in this addon are now publicly accessible through the OpenAI API. You only need:

1. An OpenAI account
2. An API key from your OpenAI account
3. Sufficient credits in your OpenAI account

**Please note that API usage is billed based on the model used. GPT-4 is more expensive than GPT-3.5-turbo. You can check current pricing at: https://openai.com/pricing**
